Most of the calculator's functionality was tested via automated (Assertion) testing in the CalculatorTest.java file
with the exceptions of zero button bug fix, approx. Gamma functionality, and PI (trig.) functionality.

Manual Testing with Running Program (Calculator Open)
1) Testing for the Zero button bug fix: repeatedly press zero button and only 1 zero should appear on screen. Also,
putting zero in front of a number is not possible. Also, zeroes can still be placed after numbers.

2) Approx. Gamma (Γ(x)) Functionality:
For any input <= 0: Output should be "Integer Input Must Be > 0"
For input x = 1: Γ(1) = (1-1)! = 0! = 1 -> output should have approximate value of one
For input x = 2: Γ(2) = (2-1)! = 1! = 1 -> output should have approximate value of one
For input x = 3: Γ(3) = (3-1)! = 2! = 2*1 = 2 -> output should have approximate value of two
For input x = 4: Γ(4) = (4-1)! = 3! = 3*2*1 = 6 -> output should have approximate value of six
For input x = 5: Γ(5) = (5-1)! = 4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24 -> output should have approximate value of twenty-four
For input x = 6: Γ(6) = (6-1)! = 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 -> output should have approximate value of one-hundred twenty
For input x = 7: Γ(7) = (7-1)! = 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720 -> output should have approximate value of seven-hundred twenty
...

3) PI (trig.) Functionality:
Press PI, then sin(x) -> output should be (approx.) zero
Press PI, then cos(x) -> output should be value of negative-one
press PI, then divide by two, then sin(x) -> output should be value of one
...


Also, the (above) testing was conducted in the video demonstration, which was cut short due to the presentation limits.
